git commit -m "Description of changes"  # Be specific!
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub

Go to your repo ‚Üí "Pull Requests" ‚Üí "New PR".

Set base: main ‚Üê compare: feature/your-feature-name.
Add a title/description and tag reviewers (you).


Review & Approve
Teammates review code, suggest changes (via comments).

Merge to main
After approval, click "Merge PR" (use Squash and Merge for clean history).
Delete the Old Branch (optional but recommended)
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name  # Local
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name  # Remote

üîπ Critical Recommendations for Teams
‚úÖ Do These:
Pull main before any new work and before creating branches  to avoid conflicts.

‚ùå Avoid These:
Pushing directly to main (use PRs!).
